Glad to see you here. My name is Xinmiao (Mia) Yu. Currently, I’m a double-degree Master student at Politecnico di Milano and Harbin Institute of Technology, supervised by [Prof.Bing Qin](http://ir.hit.edu.cn/~qinb/) and [Prof.Xiaocheng Feng](http://ir.hit.edu.cn/~xcfeng/). My current reasearch focuses on Natural language processing and multimodal generation. More specificly,
1. Vision-language comprehension
   - Enhancing vision-language models through advanced methods like reinforcement learning, cross-lingual data alignment, and mutual information maximization. 
   - Exploring challenges in text-rich visual comprehension, such as improving OCR capabilities, addressing cross-lingual disparities, and activating visual information effectively across languages.
2. Generative agents
   - Designed agent-based approach for learning on text-attributed graphs using large language models (LLMs), which explores graph structures and text features, improving performance and interpretability through state-action planning.
   - Investigating how LLM-powered agents can improve task planning by enabling robots to create and refine 3D scene maps. Using techniques like Chain-of-Thought reasoning, these agents aim to enhance task precision, efficiency, and autonomy in real-world scenarios.
